## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### About the app

This is my first time I use TypeScript in practice, unfortunately I haven't managed to complete all tasks yet such as "Services", "Helpers"

You can add, update and delete ToDo for the selected user. 

<><font color="red"> Because of backend </font> (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) <font color="red"> you cannot update a new added todo but the old ones you can update.</font></>

Props are not used in the project at all. You can see the list of tasks that belong to the selected user and change theme there.
