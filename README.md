## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### About the app

You can add, update and delete ToDo for the selected user.

Due to (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) you cannot update a new added todo but the old ones you can update. The same goes for "delete" function, you can delete only the first added todo because of fake API.

You can see the list of tasks that belong to the selected user and turn on dark mode by clicking the sun icon, learn more about a selected user, search for any user, run into "not found" page if you enter the wrong url path. There're a little more features as well.
