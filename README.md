## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### About the app

You can add, update and delete ToDo for the selected user.

Backend is based on (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) but all functions work as if it is not fake ;)

You can see the list of tasks that belong to the selected user and turn on dark mode by clicking the sun icon, learn more about a selected user, search for any user, run into "not found" page if you enter the wrong url path. There're a little more features as well.
